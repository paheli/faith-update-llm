# FaithfulUpdates

This project requires Python 3.9 and above. Please make sure you have the following packages installed: vllm, rouge_score, matplotlib, tigerscore, prometheus, and axolotl.

All the files in this project use the .pkl processed dataset format. To get the corresponding split, run `dataset.py` with the corresponding tfrecords containing folder and jsonl folder. If you need to sample from a large split, use `sample_dataset.py`.


Trained models can be found in 
`/fs/scratch/rb_bd_dlp_rng-dl01_cr_AIM_employees/students/tty3kor/fruit/` in the RNG server
